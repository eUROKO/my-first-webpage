                    In my current position as Field Service Supervisor at Netcom Africa Limited, I have been responsible for supervising the installation and maintenance of DIA, fiber, VSAT, and security services. I have also conducted on-site configuration of radios and completed layer 2 and 3 configurations, as well as conducted surveys, relocations, and maintenance and provided technical assistance to customers. I have ensured that engineers adhere to timely client schedules and safety policies, and have provided real-time and regular reports to the HOD.
                    In my previous role as a Technical Support Officer at Chibek Instrument Limited, I installed and maintained hybrid inverter/battery energy storage systems and designed solar systems with PVsyst. I also installed and maintained solar panels/mini grids and provided technical presentations and proof of concept for clients.
                    I have also received several certifications, including the Mikrotik Certified Network Associate, PLC set-up, programming, troubleshooting, and maintenance for Siemens and Allen Bradley, a comprehensive course in solar PV system design, and AutoCAD Electrical 2020 for Electrical and Automation Engineers. I also hold a Trade Test Certificate in Radio, TV, and Electronics, as well as National Technical Certificate and Federal Craft Certificate in Electronic Works.
